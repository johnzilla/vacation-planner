## 2025-03-22: Analysis of Missing Software Development Resources

### Decision

Conducted an analysis of the Vacation Planner repository to identify missing software development resources and recommend improvements prioritized for a solo developer working on an MVP.

### Rationale

* The project is in early development stage as an MVP
* As a solo developer project, resources should be focused on high-impact, low-effort improvements
* Establishing good development practices early will save time and reduce technical debt later

### Implementation Details

Identified the following missing resources:

1. **Testing Framework**
   - No unit or integration tests implemented
   - Test directories exist but are empty

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - No automated build, test, or deployment pipeline
   - Only Docker deployment configuration exists

3. **Development Workflow Tools**
   - No linting or code formatting tools
   - No pre-commit hooks or editor configuration

4. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Limited API documentation beyond basic markdown
   - No code documentation standards

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - No .env example files
   - Limited environment variable documentation

Recommended improvements prioritized as:

**High Priority:**
- Basic testing setup (pytest for backend, critical unit tests)
- Environment configuration (.env.example files)
- Code quality basics (linters, formatters)

**Medium Priority:**
- Simple CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

## 2025-03-22: Implementation of High-Priority Improvements

### Decision

Implemented the high-priority improvements identified in the analysis, focusing on testing, environment configuration, and code quality tools.

### Rationale

* These improvements provide the most immediate value for a solo developer working on an MVP
* They establish a solid foundation for future development
* They help prevent technical debt from accumulating early in the project

### Implementation Details

1. **Testing Framework**
   - Set up pytest configuration with coverage reporting
   - Created unit tests for the vacation optimizer algorithm
   - Added integration tests for the suggestions API endpoint
   - Implemented test fixtures and database mocking

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created .env.example files for both backend and frontend
   - Documented all required environment variables
   - Created a setup script to initialize the development environment

3. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Added Flake8, Black, and isort for Python code
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/Svelte code
   - Created an EditorConfig file for consistent editor settings
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks for automated checks

4. **CI Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and linting
   - Configured separate jobs for backend and frontend
   - Added build verification for the frontend

- Enhanced documentation
- Frontend enhancements (UI components, validation)

**Low Priority:**
- Monitoring and logging basics
- Security improvements
- Development experience enhancements
