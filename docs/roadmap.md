# Vacation Planner Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the Vacation Planner application.

## Top Priority Features

### 1. User Authentication System

Implement a complete authentication system to enhance security and user experience:

- **Login/Registration**: Create intuitive login and registration pages in the frontend
- **Authentication Backend**: Implement JWT or session-based authentication in the FastAPI backend
- **Protected Routes**: Ensure certain routes require authentication
- **User Profile Management**:
  - Password reset functionality
  - Account settings and preferences
  - Email verification
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiate between admin and regular users
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Password hashing and salting
  - Rate limiting for login attempts
  - CSRF protection

**Expected Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: None (can be implemented with the current architecture)

### 2. Enhanced Vacation Suggestion Algorithm

Improve the core vacation scheduling functionality with more sophisticated algorithms:

- **Advanced Optimization Factors**:
  - Weather patterns at popular destinations
  - Flight/hotel price trends during different seasons
  - Team coverage (ensuring not everyone is out at once)
  - Holiday clustering in different countries/regions
- **User Preferences**:
  - Allow users to set preferences (e.g., prefer long weekends vs. week-long vacations)
  - Support for different optimization goals (maximize days off, minimize travel costs)
- **Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Implement a rating system for suggestions
  - Use feedback to improve future suggestions
  - Personalize recommendations based on past choices
- **Visualization Tools**:
  - Calendar view with heat maps for optimal vacation periods
  - Comparison views for different scheduling options
  - Interactive adjustment of parameters with real-time updates

**Expected Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Dependencies**: Basic algorithm already in place, may require additional data sources

### 3. Automated Testing and CI/CD Pipeline

Establish a robust testing and deployment infrastructure:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Backend API endpoints
  - Business logic and algorithms
  - Database models and queries
- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end API flows
  - Database transactions and state management
- **Frontend Tests**:
  - Component testing with Svelte Testing Library
  - User interaction simulations
- **End-to-End Tests**:
  - Critical user journeys
  - Cross-browser compatibility
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated test runs on pull requests
  - Docker image building and testing
  - Staging environment deployment
  - Production deployment with approval gates
  - Database migration handling
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Error tracking integration
  - Performance monitoring
  - Usage analytics

**Expected Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Docker setup (already completed)

## Future Enhancements

After completing the top priority items, these features could be considered:

1. **Mobile App Enhancements**:
   - Push notifications for upcoming vacations
   - Offline mode support
   - Native device integrations (calendar, contacts)

2. **Team Vacation Planning**:
   - Collaborative scheduling for teams
   - Manager approval workflows
   - Team calendar views

3. **Integration with External Services**:
   - Calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
   - HR systems for automatic time-off tracking
   - Travel booking platforms

4. **Internationalization and Localization**:
   - Multi-language support
   - Region-specific holiday databases
   - Customizable date/time formats

5. **Advanced Reporting**:
   - Vacation usage analytics
   - Time-off balance forecasting
   - Department/team coverage reports

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

Ongoing maintenance tasks to consider:

1. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of libraries and frameworks
2. **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, frontend rendering improvements
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the application meets WCAG standards
4. **Documentation**: Keep API documentation and developer guides up-to-date
5. **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments
